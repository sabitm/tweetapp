# TweetApp, a Simple Twitter Clone

TweetApp is a simple web application built using Ruby on Rails that helps me learning Rails and web programming in general during my online course. This site allows users to create and view tweets. It includes features such as user authentication, tweet creation and deletion, and the ability to like and unlike other user's posts.

The application uses a SQLite3 database to store information about users and tweets. It is super simple that it didn't using any styling framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind.

## Development Environment

- Ruby: `2.4.6p354 (2019-04-01 revision 67394) [x86_64-linux-musl]`
- Gem: `2.6.14.4`
- Rails: `5.0.3`
- Bundler: `1.15.4`
- Nodejs: `v6.10.3`

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies by running `bundle install`. You can then migrate the database by running `rails db:migrate`, and start the server by running `rails server`.
